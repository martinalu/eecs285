GUI : Java SE 8 with JavaFX
There are a bunch of new layouts. Check them out.

HTML & CSS : Twitter Bootstrap

Database : JDBC



We're going to create a JavaFX based application. Java 8 introduced a few new technologies, and it's going to require us to do a bit of reading/work, but I guarantee you we'll be experts at this shit overnight.

Things I've learned so far.
There are new layout managers in Java8 that are way more logical than the ones in Java7. There is also a "Web Engine" object that inherits from the java.scene.node class. Don't know what a node is? Don't worry about it. The short explanation is that it's an element of the scene. A scene is not the overall window pane.

Note: You must be running MAMP running. This will allow you to have a local test server. If you don't know how to use MAMP, I'll teach you at meeting.
